This is a quick recap of things that you already saw in the Part-1. The following steps guide you toward the interactive image building process. 

###Getting an image and apply some changes

=== "Command"
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu:18.04
```

You will get something like the following output:

```
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:18.04' locally
18.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu
4bbfd2c87b75: Pull complete 
d2e110be24e1: Pull complete 
889a7173dcfe: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:67b730ece0d34429b455c08124ffd444f021b81e06fa2d9cd0adaf0d0b875182
Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:18.04
root@844ec9e540a5:/#
```

Run the command apt-get update to refresh the list of packages available to install.
Then run the command apt-get install figlet to install the program we are interested in.

For this simple exercise we will use `figlet`

=== "Command"
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install figlet
```

You will get something like the following output:

```

```

###Check the differences with respect to the original image

Once done type exit at the container prompt to leave the interactive session.
Now let's run docker diff to see the difference between the base image and our container.

=== "Command"
```bash
docker diff 844ec9e540a5
```

!!! tip
    Remember: you need to use your container ID. In order to get it you can always use `docker ps -a`

and the output you will get is something like

```
C /root
A /root/.bash_history
C /etc
A /etc/emacs
A /etc/emacs/site-start.d
A /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50figlet.el
C /etc/alternatives
A /etc/alternatives/figlet
C /usr
C /usr/share
A /usr/share/figlet
A /usr/share/figlet/646-ca.flc
A /usr/share/figlet/646-ca2.flc
A /usr/share/figlet/646-hu.flc
```

!!! tip
    Three different types of change are tracked by `docker diff `:
    -  A	A file or directory was added
    -  D	A file or directory was deleted
    -  C	A file or directory was changed

#Commit the changes and use your image

The last step is now to commit the changes, that way we will create a new layer with the changes we made before, and a new image using this new layer.

=== "Command"
```bash
docker commit 844ec9e540a5 interactivefiglet
```

Here we go!  we have build our first image interactively! Let's run it and test it

=== "Command"
```bash
docker run -ti interactivefiglet 
```

and test it by typing something like the following:

=== "Command"
```bash
root@be9e5e08db21:/# figlet ciao ciao 
```
you will get your expected output: 

```
      _                    _             
  ___(_) __ _  ___     ___(_) __ _  ___

root@be9e5e08db21:/#
```

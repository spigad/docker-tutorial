Let's start with interactive image build

=== "Command"
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu:18.04
```

You will get something like the following output:

```
 _          _   _       
| |        | | | |      
| |     _  | | | |  __  
|/ \   |/  |/  |/  /  \_
|   |_/|__/|__/|__/\__/ 
                        
```

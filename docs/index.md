The main objective of this part two is to learn how to build our image, to run our application/service. Two paths are discussed: 

- Building images interactively 
    - Create a container from a base image.
    - Install software manually in the container, and turn it into a new image.
    - Learn about new commands: docker commit, docker tag, and docker diff.

- Building docker images with Dockerfiles
    - Basic "instructions": a quick overview.
    - Write a Dockerfile.

The main objective of this part two is to learn how to build our image, to run our application/service. Two paths are discussed: 

- Building images interactively 
   - Create a container from a base image.
   - Install software manually in the container, and turn it into a new image.
   - Learn about new commands: docker commit, docker tag, and docker diff.

- Building docker images with Dockerfiles
   - Write a Dockerfile.
   - Build an image from a Dockerfile.

We’ll cover the following basic instructions to get you started:

* **FROM** - every Dockerfile starts with FROM, with the introduction of multi-stage builds, you can have more than one FROM instruction in one Dockerfile.
* **COPY** vs **ADD** - Add directories and files to your Docker image. ( Sometime confuesd... )
* **ENV** - set environment variables.
* **RUN** - let’s run commands.
* **USER** - when root is too mainstream.
* **WORKDIR** - set the working directory.
* **EXPOSE** - get your ports right.
<!---* **ONBUILD** - give more flexibility to your team.-->


### FROM
Every Dockerfile must start with the FROM instruction in the form of FROM `<image>[:tag]`. This will set the base image for your Dockerfile, which means that subsequent instructions will be applied to this base image.

**The tag value is optional**, if you don’t specify the tag Docker will use the tag **latest** and will try and use or pull the latest version of the base image during build.

On the little bit more advanced side, let’s note the following:

There is one instruction that you can put before FROM into your Dockerfile. This instruction is **ARG**. ARG is used to specify arguments for the docker build command with the **--build-arg** `<varname>=<value>` flag.
You can have more than one FROM instructions in your Dockerfile. You will want to use this feature, for example, when you use one base image to build your app and another base image to run it.
It’s called a multi-stage build and you can read about it [here](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

This is why every section that starts with FROM in your Dockerfile is called a build stage (even in the simple case of having only one FROM instruction). You can specify the name of the build stage in the form `FROM <image>[:tag] [AS <name>]`.

### COPY vs ADD
Both ADD and COPY are designed to add directories and files to your Docker image in the form of `ADD <src>... <dest>` or `COPY <src>... <dest>`. Most resources, **suggest to use COPY**.

The reason behind this is that ADD has extra features compared to COPY that make ADD more unpredictable and a bit over-designed. ADD can pull files from url sources, which COPY cannot. ADD can also extract compressed files assuming it can recognize and handle the format. You cannot extract archives with COPY.

The ADD instruction was added to Docker first, and COPY was added later to provide a straightforward, rock solid solution for copying files and directories into your container’s file system.

If you want to pull files from the web into your image I would suggest to use RUN and curl and uncompress your files with RUN and commands you would use on the command line.

### ENV
ENV is used to define environment variables. The interesting thing about ENV is that it does two things:

- You can use it to define environment variables that will be available in your container. So when you build an image and start up a container with that image you’ll find that the environment variable is available and is set to the value you specified in the Dockerfile.
- You can use the variables that you specify by ENV in the Dockerfile itself. So in subsequent instructions the environment variable will be available.

### RUN
RUN will execute commands, so it’s one of the most-used instructions. I would like to highlight two points:

- You’ll use a lot of apt-get type of commands to add new packages to your image. It’s always advisable **to put apt-get update and apt-get install commands on the same line**. This is important because of layer caching. Having these on two separate lines would mean that if you add a new package to your install list, the layer with apt-get update will not be invalidated in the layer cache and you might end up in a mess. Read more here.
- RUN has two forms; `RUN <command>` (called shell form) and `RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"]` called exec form. Please note that `RUN <command>` will invoke a shell automatically (/bin/sh -c by default), while the exec form will not invoke a command shell. If you want to tackle a problem around this read here.

### USER
Don’t run your stuff as root, use the USER instruction to specify the user. This user will be used to run any subsequent RUN, CMD AND ENDPOINT instructions in your Dockerfile.

### WORKDIR
A very convenient way to define the working directory, it will be used with subsequent RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions. You can specify WORKDIR multiple times in a Dockerfile.

If the directory does not exists, Docker will create it for you.

### EXPOSE
An important instruction to inform your users about the ports your application is listening on. EXPOSE will not publish the port, you need to use docker run -p... to do that when you start the container.

### CMD and ENTRYPOINT
CMD is the instruction to specify what component is to be run by your image with arguments in the following form: CMD [“executable”, “param1”, “param2”…].

You can override CMD when you’re starting up your container by specifying your command after the image name like this: `$ docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]`.

You can only specify one CMD in a Dockerfile (OK, physically you can specify more than one, but only the last one will be used).

So what’s the deal with ENTRYPOINT? When you specify an entry point, your image will work a bit differently. You use ENTRYPOINT as **the main executable of your image**. In this case whatever you specify in CMD will be added to ENTRYPOINT as parameters.

<!--- ### ONBUILD
This is so nice. You can specify instructions with ONBUILD that will be executed when your image is used as the base image of another Dockerfile. :)

This is useful when you want to create a generic base image to be used in different variations by many Dockerfiles, or in many projects or by many parties.

So you do not need to add the specific stuff immediately, like you don’t need to copy the source code or config files in the base image. How could you even do that, when these things will be available only later?

So what you do instead is to add ONBUILD instructions. So you can do something like this:

ONBUILD COPY . /usr/src/app
ONBUILD RUN /usr/src/app/mybuild.sh
ONBUILD instructions will be executed right after the FROM instruction in the downstram Dockerfile
